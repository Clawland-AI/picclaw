**Title:** [Project] Clawland: Open-source AI agents running on $10 hardware – contributors share 20% of revenue

**Body:**

Hey everyone! We're building **Clawland**, an open-source ecosystem of AI agents designed to run on dirt-cheap hardware and replace expensive human monitoring jobs.

## What is it?

A family of AI agents at different scales:

| Agent | Lang | RAM | HW Cost | Use |
|-------|------|-----|---------|-----|
| picclaw | Go | <10MB | $10 | Edge sensing + local decision |
| moltclaw | TS | >1GB | Cloud | Multi-agent routing |
| nanoclaw | Python | >100MB | $50 SBC | Rich ecosystem tasks |
| microclaw | C/Rust | <1MB | $2 MCU | Sensor-level agent |

## Real numbers

- **$88 kit** → replaces $48K/yr data center night shift operator (99% savings)
- **$133 kit** → replaces $30K/yr fish pond patrol worker (99% savings)
- **$95 kit** → replaces $18K/yr greenhouse attendant (98% savings)

## Build to Earn

This isn't donation-ware. We're offering a deal:

- **20% of net product revenue** → Contributor Revenue Pool
- **Quarterly payouts** via Open Collective (full transparency)
- **First 10 Core Maintainers** → additional 0.5% lifetime revenue share

## We need

- **Go devs**: picclaw edge agent (ARM cross-compile, GPIO integration)
- **TypeScript devs**: moltclaw cloud gateway (multi-agent routing)
- **Python devs**: nanoclaw + sensor driver libraries
- **Hardware hackers**: sensor kits, wiring, drivers
- **Technical writers**: docs, tutorials
