**Title:** Show HN: Clawland – Open-source edge AI agents on $10 hardware, contributors share 20% revenue

**URL:** https://github.com/Clawland-AI

**Text (if self-post):**

We built an open-source family of AI agents that run on hardware from $2 MCUs to cloud servers:

- picclaw (Go, <10MB RAM) – $10 RISC-V edge agent
- moltclaw (TypeScript) – Cloud gateway with multi-agent routing
- nanoclaw (Python) – Mid-weight agent on $50 SBCs
- microclaw (C/Rust, <1MB) – Sensor-level micro agent on $2 MCUs

Combined with cheap sensors ($5-50), these agents can sense (temperature, humidity, dissolved oxygen, vibration), think (LLM-powered analysis with 8+ providers), act (relays, valves, switches via GPIO), and report (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, 7 channels).

Real-world examples:
- $88 kit replaces $48K/yr data center night shift operator
- $133 kit replaces $30K/yr fish pond patrol worker
- $95 kit replaces $18K/yr greenhouse attendant

**Revenue sharing model:** 20% of net product revenue goes into a Contributor Revenue Pool. Quarterly payouts via Open Collective. First 10 Core Maintainers get an additional 0.5% lifetime share.

We're looking for Go/TypeScript/Python developers and hardware hackers.
