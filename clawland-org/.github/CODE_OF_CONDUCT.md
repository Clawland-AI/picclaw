# Clawland Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Clawland community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

TSC members are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

TSC members have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including GitHub repositories, Discussions, Discord, and any other Clawland communication channel. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the TSC at **conduct@clawland.dev** (or via GitHub Discussions private message to any TSC member).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All TSC members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

**2. Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban** — A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
